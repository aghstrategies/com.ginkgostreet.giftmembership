# com.ginkgostreet.giftmembership

Makes gift memberships possible via a public contribution page's honoree
section. The soft-credited contact will be made the owner of the membership.
Administrators can specify which soft credit types trigger the behavior.

Note that the configuration is not form-specific and will trigger regardless
of when or how the membership payment is made. Aside from the administrator's
settings screen (Administer > CiviMember > Gift Membership Settings), this
extension has no interface elements.
